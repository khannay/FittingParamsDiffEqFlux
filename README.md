# Fitting Differential Equations Parameters using a Neural Networks Approach

Some tutorial programs fiiting differentiable equation parameters using the DiffEqFlux and sciml packages for Julia. 

The idea of this repo is to store some examples which go beyond the excellent documentation provided by these libraries.
